## Clojure and the JVM 
- Clojure was designed as a modern dialectic of LISP 
- Its implmented on top of the Java Virtual Machine, although its syntax is simple it might seem unfamiliar compared to Java. 
- It has direct support for concurrency 
	- Meaning that it is suitable for multi-core platforms
---
## Expressions and Forms 
- Clojure code is constructed as a series of expressions of _forms_
- Each expression consists of 2 basic elements 
	- Data types or data structures
	- Some operation on this data
- Expressions are always written in parenthesis 
	- The first value in the parenthsesis is the operaiton
	- The remaining values are data that the operation will act upon
```clojure
(+ 2 2)
; Note the following about the expression: 
; 1.) The expression is closed in "()"
; 2.) There are no commas normally, things are seperated by whitespace
; 3.) Basic math notations use prefix style instead of infix
```

## The REPL
- REPL is like a command line interface (similar to what Python has)
- 
---
## Clojure return values
- All expressions in Clojure return a value 
- 
---
## Function defintions
---
## Control flow
---
## Truthy and Falsey values
