## Classes, Objects, and Methods
- Objected oriented languages define classes that expose a set of methods that can, in turn, be invoked by calling applications.
- OO style provides significant improvements in code isolation and re-use, including:
	- Simple inheritance logic
	- Polymorphic methods
- We see methods as being contained within the object 
	- and that methods act upon data members that are also inside the object (this is wrong)

## The logical view of classes and methods

- When the Dog object is instantiated, values are provided for the name and age 
	- The associated methods can then act on the values of the specific object 
#### The physical implementation 
- At the level of machine code, there are obviously no notions of classes or objects 
- In the simplest case, an object will be similar to what a `struct` is in C
