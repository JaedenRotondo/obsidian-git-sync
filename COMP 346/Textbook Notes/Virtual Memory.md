### 9.3.1 Basic method of Paging 
---
- Paging allows for a processes memory space to be non-contiguos 
- Paging solves the problem of fragmentation and compaction 
- Paging involves splitting up physcial memory into fixed-sized blocks called **frames** and logical memory into fixed-sized blocks called **pages**
	- When the page is needed, it is loaded into main memory 
- Every address generated by the CPU is divided into two parts: a *page number* (p) and a *page offset* (d):

- The page number is used as an index which is found in the *page table*

- Internal fragmentation is possibly in the last frame because
	- If we need 35 pages plus one byte, it will require 36 frames 
- The operating system keeps a copy of the page table for each process, so paging therefore increases context-swtiching time
