# Quine on What There Is 
## Names and Existence 
- The nominalist wants to say: "Abstract entities do not exist"
- The realist responds: "Ypu want to predicate something about abstract entities, namely they do not exist. However, if they do not exist, how are you able to predicate on them?"
- The nominalist responds: "Here are all the things that could exist, and among them is the abstract enetities". Only some of the "possible things" actually exist, and the abstract entities are not among them. 
- Quine has questions about this, for instance, if we are referring to these possible things, don't they *exist in some way?* 
#### The reaccuring example of Pegasus 
- "Pegasus does not exist" 
	- What is this sentence saying? 
	- If the sentence is talking about pegausus, then pegasus must exist
	- If the sentence is not talking about pegausus, it is not denying the existence of pegasus 

- **McX**'s position: Pegasus is an idea in the mind 
- **Wayman**'s position: Pegausus is merely a "possible thing", it doesn't exist but it *subsists *

## Quine's Solution
#### Russel's Theory of Descriptions
- The sentence: "The author of waverly was a poet" should be understood as: 
	- There is something that write Waverly and was a poet 
- Quine's argument is that we do not need subsisting objects to serve as meanings for "pegasus" 
- For everything, nothing pegaisizes
## A Criterion for ontological commitments 
- We know that sayinh "Pegasus does not exist" does not commit us to the existence of Pegasus
- Does "The bottle is blue" commit us to blueness? 
	- No, we can involve ourselves in ontological commitments by the use of _bound variables_
- A person is committed to the existence of Ks if they accept a theory that is committed to Ks	
	- A theory is commited to the existence of K iff every domain of quanitification that makes the theory true contains K 
## Simplicity and Myth 
- Quine argues that we should always chose the best theory of everything, and if there are two contending theories, we should chose the simpler one 
- 

- What is the riddle of nonBeing in McX's position 
	- How can you talk about **pegasus** if it is non-existant. It means that non-existance needs to be included in your ontology 
	- Pegasus exists as an "unactualized possible"
- Quine on "unactualized impossibilites" the *round square object *
	- Quine says these statements are not *meangingless* they are just *false* and he uses Russels theory of description to explain this 
- Bound variables 
	- *everything, something, nothing *
	- Range across our ontology 
- Abstract reference commits us to universals, saying "This is blue" does not
