> If you believe that things of kind X exist, then you are a metaphysical realist about things of kind X 

- There are two types of *abstract identities* that are people can be metaphysical realists about
	1. Universals: Properties, relations, kinds
		- things that are not particulars. Blueness in this bottle vs the idea of blue 
		- Universals are repeatable 
	1. Abstract entities: numbers, sets, concepts, etc 
- **Platonic Realism**: If two objects are blue, its is because they share and exemplify the property of blueness 
	- The "Equal" itself, the "Beautiful" itself

### Plato's 4 Arguments for Platonic Realism
#### 1. Argument for impossible mistake
- Two sticks that show equality in length can actually be unequal in length
- Equality of length itself cannot appear unequal in length 
- If X can appear to be F, but Y does not appear to be F, then X != Y
*- Therefore, Equality as such, and the equality of length we find in two sticks are distinct from each other* 
- What is wrong with this argument? Premise P3 is a wrong application of Leibnizâ€™s Law
#### 2. Argument from knowledge
- For many properties, we know that things we see never possess the property perfectly 
	- For example, we know that things are somewhat equal to each other, or are somewhat "Just" but are never perfect forms of equality or justice
- For something to be known not to possess X in a perfect way, it means that we must have some apriori knowledge that is standard about this property, for which we can argue that something is an "imperfect representation"
- This leads to the idea that there *necessarily* exists universals that we have knowledge of 
- **objection**: Nominalists will say that they know what a perfectly fucntioning car would lbe like, even if they have never seen one. Who's to say they can not just idealize the bad cars theyve seen to reach a conlcusion about what the perfect car would be like? 
#### 3. Argument from subject-predicate discourse

#### 4. Argument from absrtract references

### Problems for Realism 

### Plato's 3rd man argument 
- Infinite regress, the form of the form 
- a,b,c exemplofy Fness, but Fness needs to contain all of itself, therefore we need a new form that represents the whole
- you need the particulars and the form and make a new form
