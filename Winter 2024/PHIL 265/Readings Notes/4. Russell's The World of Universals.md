# Rusell's The World of Universals
## Russell's Arguments for Realism
### Argument from True Sentences
1. Verbs stand for universals 
2. Every true sentence contains at least one verb 
3. Therefore, every true sentence contains a verb that refers to a universal 
4. If a sentence contains a word that stands for X, and the sentence is true, than X exists
5. True sentences are true 
6. Therefore, universals exist

### Argument for Resembelance Relations 

- Prepositions *x is behind y* is a relations. And relations exist outside of the objects themselves 
- Edinburgh is north of london is true whether or not we know this is the case or not 
	- Even if london and edinburgh cease to exist, those two points in location would still subsist
