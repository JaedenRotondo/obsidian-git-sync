# Rusell's The World of Universals
## Russell's Arguments for Realism
### Argument from True Sentences
1. Verbs stand for universals 
2. Every true sentence contains at least one verb 
3. Therefore, every true sentence contains a verb that refers to a universal 
4. If a sentence contains a word that stands for X, and the sentence is true, than X exists
5. True sentences are true 
6. Therefore, universals exist

### Argument for Resembelance Relations 
- Russell takes the argument of the nominalist who says that universals dont exist, rather we see _resememblence_ between two particulars. 
- He argues that what is resembled between two particulars has the characterist of the universal, and ultimately one falls into the trap of using _resemblence_ as a universal 

- Prepositions *x is behind y* is a relations. And relations exist outside of the objects themselves 
- Edinburgh is north of london is true whether or not we know this is the case or not 
	- Even if london and edinburgh cease to exist, those two points in location would still subsist 
- 

## Why Philosophers Went Astray 
- We seem to systematically ignore universals in our language 
	- When we say "Tara's head" we think that we are only speaking of particulars
	- However, _head_ by itself is a universal, but is only a particular once we assert that it is Tara's
- Russel argues that *universals don't exist, they subsist* and *Particulars have existence, while universals have being* 

### Universals are not in the mind 
- Russel believes that universals subsist in reality, and are not created by our mind. 
- Using the "North of" relation as an example
	- When we say that Edinburgh is north of London, this would be a true statement regardless of whether or not we have it in our minds, therefore the relation "North of" exists outside of the mind. 

### The Act-Content Distinction 
- Russel argues that people mistake universals for the act of thinking about universals 
- When someone says they are thinking about New York, people mistakenly think this doesn't refer to the city and actually it refers to an item in my mind
