# Mellor on Time 
## Tense and Time 
- A theorists and B theorists disagree on the existence of tense
    - A Theory: believes that tense exists, e.g. future tense form represents futurity 
    - B Theory: Tense does not exist, saying "I am in New York" vs "I was in New York" is the same as a "here" vs "there" difference
### Old B Theory attempt to not use tense
#### Translation into Lnaguage with Explicit Dates
- Saying _it rained yesterday_ can be converted into _It rains on March 13th 2024_
- But these two setnences are not actually equivalent, what if we have a different understanding of what today/yesterday is? 
#### Translation into token reflexive language 
- "it rained yesterday" can be converted into "It rains one day before this utterance" 
- But these two setences are again not equal 
    - The token reflexive sentence involves/requires an utterance, but the one on the left has no such implication 
### New B theory 
- All the B theorists need are "tensless truth conditions" for all tensed sentences 
    - For example, 
## Mellor clarifying McTaggarts argument against the A-series
- McTaggarts argument about the A Series is that it is incoherent because being past, present, and future together is not compatible 
- The reply from A Theorists: They do not happen at the same time, something is only future if it has not happened yet
- reply to reply: this is a second incoherence that leads to a viscious cycle. 
## Token-reflexive truth conditions
- Truth conditions of tensed sentences are token-reflexive
- Token reflexive truth conditions are tensless
- This means that the underlying facts that make up a truth condition are actually tensless. Since we do not need tense to make a sentence true then tense does not exist

## Mellor's argument against the A theory 
- The new B theory
    - tense is ineliminable in language but not in reality
- Token reflexive truth conditions 
    - "It was the case that P is true, as uttered at T, if and only if there is some time T' before T, such that P is the case at T'.
