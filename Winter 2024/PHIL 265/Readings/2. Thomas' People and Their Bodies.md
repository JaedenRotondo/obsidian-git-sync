## Numeric and Qualitative Identity 
- *Qualitatively identical*: "The A-String on my guitar broke, i replaced it with one exactly the same"
- *numerically identical*: "The house I grew up with my mother has changed a lot, but its still the same house"
- Sets can also be used to differentiate qualitative and numerical identity
## A Puzzle about Personal Identity
### Numerical Identity and Persons 
- Over time, the identity of people is a tricky problem
- Spock example: If we tele-transport spock by scanning/destroying all his particles and we arrange new particles on two seperate new worlds, *where is spock?*
	- **Option 1:** Spock no longer exists, Neither resulting person is spock 
	- **Option 2:** Spock is one of the resulting people. 
		- There are many problems with this. How do we pick which one is spock ? 
	- **Option 3:** Both resulting persons are identical to Spock 
		- Problem: The 2 new Spocks are clearly not identitical to each other, so how could they be identical? 
		- If a=c, and a=c.... then b = c
## J.J. Thomson on Personal Identity 
- **Physical Thesis**: People are their bodies
- **Physical Criterion**: For persons, x=y, if and only if x's body is equal to y's body
- Thomson would hold that neither person is Spock, and that tele-transportation would be impossible because the bodie's are *numerically different*
#### Alternative Criteria for Personal Identity
- **Pyshcological Criterion (Connectedness)**: States that people are identical to each other if they are psychologically connected 
##### Body Switching
- **Pure Psychological Criterion**: Transporting a persons psychology is *necessary and sufficient* for body swtiching 
- **Impure Psychological Criterion**: Transporting a person's psychology, by way of transferring their brain, is *necessary and sufficient* for body swtiching 

#### Thomson's Overall Argument
- People are their bodies: Two people are identitical if and only if they have the same body 
- Psychological connectedness is unimportant in defining what the true identity of a person is

#### Four Ideas behind her argument 
1. Simple Brain Transplant: Brown Case 1 
2. Mere Brains: Brown Case 2
3. Queen Victoria: No matter what you think, you are not Queen Ann 
4. Duplication: Psychological criterion allows for duplication, but the physcial criterion doesnt (Brown Case 4)
