> Cybersecurity usually requires a vast amount of knowledge which is typically obtainable after a handful of years of experience. When entering cybersecurity, one should have a firm understanding of the following concepts: 

### Networking 
- tcp/ip stack
- protocols
- vlans
- ubnetting
- various vpn technologies
- ip tables and access control lists
- wireless technologies
- DHCP
- DNS
- DNSSEC
- routing
- packet analysis

### networking equipment
- firewalls
- layer 2 and layer 3 switches
- repeaters
- bridges
- intrusion detection/prevention systems

### programming 
- c
- c++
- python
- java script
- SQL
- rust 

### scripting 
- powershell
- bash

### servers 
- domain controllers
- DNS servers
- application servers
- file servers
- proxy servers
- web servers
- email servers
- virtualization
- load balancing
### operating systems 
- linux
- mac
- windows (domain vs workgroup setups), 

### Other
- how anti virus applications function
- Common Attack vectors and how to prevent them
- fuzzing applications
- incident response (and local laws and regulations regarding incident response), 
- Network scanning
- shells/ reverse shells
- buffer overflow basics
- passive and active information gathering techniques
- email header analysis
- cryptography and hash functions
- cloud environments (Citrix, Azure, O365)
