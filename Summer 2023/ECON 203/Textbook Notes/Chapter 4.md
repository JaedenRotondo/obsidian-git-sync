## Learning Objectives
1.  Define the key macroeconomic variables: national income, unemployment, productivity, inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, and net exports.
2. Understand that most macroeconomic issues are about either long-run growth or short-run fluctuations, and that government policy is relevant for both.
> Macroeconomics is concerned with the behaviour and performance of the economy as a whole. How different indicators can be affected by government decisions, unlike the particularities of individual markets (what is dealt with in microeconomics)

- A full understanding of macroeconomics requires understanding the nature of short-run fluctuations as well as the nature of long-run economic growth.

# Key Macroeconomic Variables

## National Income 
- The value of national product is by definition equal to the national income 
- **Nominal National Income**: Is the *dollar* amount of the national income, when you take the units sold mulitplied by their respective prices 
- National income changes for one of two reasons, but usually a mix of both: 
	1. The country produced more goods
	2. The price of goods has gone up 
- **Real national income** (constant dollar) only includes the increase from products only as opposed to *current dollar income*
- Periods in which real GDP actually falls are called **recessions**.
- The **business cycle** refers to this continual ebb and flow of business activity that occurs around the long-term trend.

##### Potential Output and the Output Gap 
- A national income / output (Y) for one reason or another is not equal to the potential possible output of the productive forces (Y*)
- The **output gap** measures the difference between potential output and actual output, and is computed as (Y - Y*). When actual output is less than potential output , the gap measures the market value of goods and services that are not being produced because the economy’s resources are not fully employed.
	- When Y* is greater than Y its called a *recessionary gap*
	- When Y is greater than Y* its called an inflationary gap 

- Why does national income matter? 
	- Recessions are tied to unemployment and economic loss
	- Long run growth will determine the quality of life of people 
	- 

## Employment, Unemployment, and the Labour Force
- Unemployment is calculated as the fraction of unemployed people divided by the labour force as a hole
- The labour force is all people who can work, regardless of their employment status
- When the economy is at potential GDP its called *"full employment"* but there still might be unemployment for two reasons:
	- **Frictional Unemployment:** A type of unemployment that is considered normal turnaround at companies. 
	- **Structural Unemployment**: When the workforce has skills which are not adapted properly to the market (which is adapting constantly)
- Uemployment obviosuly pushes people into poverty. Long term unemploymeny is more devastating than short term 

## Productivity 
- Productivity growth is the single largest cause of rising material living standards over long periods of time.
- Rising employment generally results from a rising population, but at times is also explained by an increase in the proportion of the population that chooses to participate in the labour force. 
- Second, Canada’s stock of physical capital—the buildings, factories, and machines used to produce output—has increased more or less steadily over time. 
- Third, _productivity_ in Canada has increased in almost every year over the past half-century.

## Inflation and the Price Level
- Inflation measures the chanve in price level 
- Price level is the current average price of a goods or service
	- The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the best known price index
	- Price indexes are measured without units, it is relatice to a base (in CPIs case its 2002)
	- Inflation can be calculated easily from a price index as so
		$$\frac{current - base}{base}\cdot 100$$
## Interest
- Nominal interest rate is the price paid per dollar borrowed over a period of time 
- Principle is the amount that was lended to begin with 
- Because the value of the dollar changes, we refere to real interest rate as the buying power of the nominal interest rate (nominal interest rate - inflation)
- Loans can end up having a real interest rate that is negative if the inflation is higher than the nominal interest rate 

## Exchange Rates and Trade Flows 
- Canada US exchange rate has been very volatile over the last 5 decades
- the trade-weighted exchange rate in canada is very similar to the exchnage rate between Canada and US (reflects that US is Canada's biggest trade partner)

# 4.2 Growth vs Fluctuations 
- Macroeconomics is concerned witht the long run and short run fluctuatoins 
- since 1975 the Canadian GDP has tripled, this shows great growth. Year to year the GDP fluctuates though 
- Some economists believe that a policy designed to keep inflation low and stable will contribute to the economy’s growth.
- Some, however, believe there are dangers from having inflation too low—that a moderate inflation rate is more conducive to growth than a very low inflation rate.
