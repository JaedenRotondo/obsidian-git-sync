# 5.1 NATIONAL OUTPUT AND VALUE ADDED
- The output of a company cannot simply be calculated do to double counting 
- The best way to calculate **value added** is to distinguish between intermediary and final products
- 
# 5.2 NATIONAL INCOME ACCOUNTING: THE BASICS
> The value of domestic output is equal to the value of the expenditure on that output and is also equal to the total income generated by producing that output.

- National income is equal to national product
### GDP from the expenditure side
- Is the sum of: 
	- Consumption
		- Goods and services sold to their final users
	- Investment 
		- Not for present consumption, includes inventory 
		- There are 3 types of investment goods:
			1. Changes in inventories: Stocks of raw materials, goods in process, and finished goods held by firms 
			2. **New Plant and Equiptment**": capital stock (machinery, computers etc)
			3. **New Residential Housing**: is considered an investemnt (including its construction)
			4. Total investment is the sum of all the changes in inventory over a period of time, the sume of new plant and equiptment and additions to residential housing
	- Government purchases: Social workers, firefighters, military are all considered government expenditure
		- Note that government purchases e.g. paying pentions does not count towards the GDP - these are called *transfer payments*
		- Note that government expenditure is calculated using cost as opposed to market value 
	- net exports:
		- **Exports**: When german households buy Canadian products, this is considered expenditure on Canadian output 
		- **Imports**: When you buy a japanese made car, a lot of that value goes to Japans output expenditure 
		- Net exports are defined as total exports minus total imports (X - IM)
- GDP from the expenditure side is : C + I + G +(X - IM)

### Gdp from income side 
- **Factor incomes**: includes Wages and salaries, interest, and business profits
	- Is alco called net domestic income
- **Non-factor payments**: Includes taxes and depreciation 
	- Sometimes the government gives subsidies to firms which are considered like negative taxes
	- Depreciation refers to the amount needed to repair machniery and such
