# Economic Theories, Data and Graphs

# **2.1 Positive and Normative Statements**
- There are two types of advice the economists will give: 
	1. **Normative**: Advice that depends on a value judgement. It tells others what they "ought" to do 
	2. **Positive**: Advice that doesnt depend on a value judgement. It says to do this you will have to do so by following xyz
- To determine whether a statement is positive or normative:
	- Positive statements are factual and can be scientifically determined
	- Normative statements require a value judgement

#  **2.2 Building and Testing Economic Theories**
---
- Theories (sometimes called models) seek to explain things using *variables, assumptions, and predictions*
- **Variables**: A well defined item, such as the quantity or price of a commodity that can take on various values 
	- **Endogenous Variables**: Value is determined within the theory 
	- **Exogenous Variables**: Determines the Endogenous variables but is itself is determined outside the theory 
- **Assumptions**: Concerns motives, directions of causation, conditions of application
	- **Motives**: We must label the motives of the different actors in the theory. We need to assume that not only do people are "maximizers" but that they know how to maximize
	- **Direction of Causation**: Most theories include a causal relationship. It must be made clear which way the causal relationship forms. For example, the supply of wheat produces have increases with warming weather. The relationship is that the weather affects the supply and not vice versa
	- **Conditions of Application**: Assumptions are often used to specify the conditions under which the model holds true 
- Assumptions do not need to be 100% realistic for a theory to be true. For example the asusmption that people want to maximize profits may not be true of all managers (some might care about the environment) but it has a strong enough truthness to have an affect on the economy
## Testing Theories 
- A theory is trsted by confronting its predictions with empirical evidence 
- **Statistical Analysis**:
