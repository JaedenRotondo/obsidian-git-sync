## Economic Issues and Concepts
---
## What is Economics 
- Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources to satisfy unlimited human wants
- Oppurtunity cost is a ratio, it is the value of the next best alternative '
### Production Possibilities Boundary 
- The tradeoff between choice can be expressed as a combination![[Screenshot 2023-05-12 at 9.23.34 AM.png]]
	- The negatively sloped boundary shows the combinations that are attainable when all resources are used efficiently.

### Four key economic problems 
1. What is produced and how (resource allocation)
2. What is consumed and by who (distribution)
3. Why are resources sometimes idle? 
4. Is productive capacity growing? 
- These four economic problems can be shaped by the government. Especially topics like economic growth and imo crisis economics

# 1.2The Complexity of Modern Economics
- The current day economy is very complex. When you buy milk from the store it uses the cooperation of global production 
- **Self organizing** economies is not coordinated (planned) by a governing body, it is left up to nobody (you can see why this is anarchic)
- Self organization of the economy is based on the idea that people are *maximizers* and will look at *marginal cost* and perform the action which will serve them best.
- There are 3 types of decision makers in modern economics
	1. Consumers
	2. Producers
	3. Governemnt bodies
- Marginal decisions are decisions which choices are are argued on the bases of their marginal benefit vs marginal cost

## Circular Flow of Income and Expenditure

- The red line shows the flow of goods and services; the blue line shows the payments made to purchase these.
- **Factor Markets**: Where factors of production are bought and sold
- **Goods Markets** Where commodities are bought and sold

# 1.3 Alternative to the Market Economy
- Types of Economic systems
	1. *Traditional Economy*: An economy where behavious is mostly based on tradition. You do what your father did, common in earlier times
	2. *Command Economies*: Also called planned economies, where some central authority makes necessary decisions about the economy 
	3. *Free Market Economy*: Where most economic decisions are are made by private households and firms 
	4. *Mixed Economies*: Most economic behaviour is a mix of the different economies
- Textbook gives a neoliberal argument for the mixed economy

## Government in the Modern Economy
> Key institutions are private property and freedom of contract, both of which must be maintained by active government policies. The government creates laws of ownership and contract and then provides the institutions, such as police and courts, to enforce these laws.

- In modern mixed econiomies, governments go way beyond the above duties. They intervene according to economists to prevent *market failures*
	- For example pollutions and ruining the environement is something that produces might want to do because its profitable, hence the government needs to step in
- **Public goods**: e.g. Police and Defence
- Since 2008 there has been a trend of the government intervening more in the economy as opposed to the 80s free market trend
