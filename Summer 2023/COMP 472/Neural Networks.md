### The human brain 
- The brain is still a large mystery to us. But we understand the neuron very well. 
	- The neuron takes in an input from dendrites, and generates an output 
	- Neurons are all connected to each other (at least in their respective networks)
- **this is a very simplified explanantion of the nervous system**
- We want to simulate something that works the same way 
- The brain is plastic, the. connections are not static they are constantly adpating and chinging and dying

## Deep Learning
- Deep learning is a broad family of techniques used to develop complex algebraic circuits to learn abstraction 
	- It is "deep" becuase these circuits are typically organized into layers where there are many steps between the input and the output 
- Deep learning is currently the most widely used to approach for applications such as visual object recognition, machine translation (natural language processing), speech synthesis etc. 
	- It can do better than humans in at least some of these areas

	- C is better than B and better than A, as it is more complex and more accurately represents the human brain 

#### Feedforward network 
- Has connections in onw direction (a directed acyclic graph) with designated input and output nodes. No loops ! 
- Each node computes a function of its inputs and passes results to its successor nodes in the network 
#### Recurrent network 
- The output is feeded back as input

Assignment: 
- What kind of weights will we put 
- What bias will we use
- The funcitons to decide whether the neuron fires or not
