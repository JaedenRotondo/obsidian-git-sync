- The discussion between Socrates and Polemarchus starts the views of Cephalus (an aged man whos house they are walking to). Cephalus claims that "while these burdens are eased by wealth (burdens of old age), it is people's character and habits that reakky determine whether or not their lives are hard to bear, not their age. Wealth is important mostly because it reduces the likelyhood that someone will be tempted into being unjust because he is poor, and so lessons his fear of what will happen to him after he dies (328b-331b)"
	- Cephalus argues that justice is speaking the truth and paying ones debts 
- Thraymachus is irritated by the examination of Sorates and asks him to forward his own definition of justice, instead of simply referring to other peoples
	- Thraysmchus argues that justice is the advantage of the stronger.
