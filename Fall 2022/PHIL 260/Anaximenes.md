### Biography 
- Born in the city of Miletus 
- Student of Anaximander
-  Might or might not have benn corresponding with Pythagoras

## Main ideas 
 Held that air is the arche (what everything comprises of)
> 13A5) Anaximenes . . . like Anaximander, declares that the underlying nature is one and unlimited [apeiron] but not indeterminate, as Anaximander held, but definite, saying that it is air. It differs in rarity and density according to the substances \<it becomes>. Becoming finer, it comes to be fire; being condensed, it comes to be wind, then cloud; and when still further condensed, it becomes water, then earth, then stones, and the rest come to be from these. He too makes motion eternal and says that change also comes to be through it.(Theophrastus, quoted by Simplicius, Commentary on Aristotle’s Physics 24.26–25.1)

- His belief was that, based on temperature, matter would change forms. Hsi forms were incoorect but his general principle was right 
	- mist/steam when cold condensates into water, then into ice
	- or: gaseous -> liquid -> solid 
- "Breath of life" is a devine attribute, Anixamder could have been influenced by this


### Doctrine of Change 
- Anaximenese doctrine of change is crude but empirical in nature 
> Anaximenes stated that clouds occur when the air is further thickened. When it is condensed still more, rain is squeezed out. Hail occurs when the falling water freezes, and snow when some wind is caught up in the moisture. (Aëtius 3.4.1)

> It differs in rarity and density according to the substances \<it becomes>. Becoming finer, it comes to be fire; being condensed, it comes to be wind, then cloud; and when still further condensed, it becomes water, then earth, then stones, and the rest come to be from these. He too makes motion eternal and says that change also comes to be through it. (Theophrastus, quoted by Simplicius, Commentary on Aristotle’s Physics 24.26–25.1)

- This is not fundemantally incorrect, if you examine the molecular structure of elements of the different stages it follows the same pattern 
	- plasma condenses to gas to liquid to solid 





- Bleieved that the individual is a smaller cell of a larger kosmos
