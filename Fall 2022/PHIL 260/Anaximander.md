# Anaximander 
> Diogenes Laertius says that Anaximander was sixty-four years old in 547/6 BCE, and this dating agrees with the ancient reports that say that Anaximander was a pupil or follower of Thales. He was said to have been the first person to construct a map of the world, to have set up a gnomon at Sparta, and to have predicted an earthquake.

- Wrote the first book on natural philosophy called "On Nature" (lost) (very common title name)
- He was the first to construct the sun dial 
	- His sundual in sparta tracked seasons rather than hours* 
	- Time telling started with seasons of the year, not hours of the day 
		- The pragmatic purpose for this is quite clear, knowing the point of the season can prepare you for harvest, planting, etc etc 
		- When to go to war was also based on season, the ancient greeks did not go to war in the winter
	- Assertion made by Philip Thibodeau (Quebec-American academic)
- Why was Anaximander able to predict the earthquake in Sparta
	- Before a large earthquake, it is standard for tremours to occur prior 
	- The process of an earthquake is dialectical, these tremors are the phenomena before quantity turns to quality 
	- Anaximander all those in the city to escape and ended up being right 
- In the first changes from the originating apeiron, Anaxi- mander postulates substantial opposites (the hot, the cold) that act on one another and that are in turn the generating stuffs for the sensible world. The reciprocal action of the opposites is the subject of B1, the only direct quotation we have from Anaximander
	- he affirms that there are lawlike forces guaranteeing the orderly processes of change between opposites
	> Fragment: \[O]f those who declared that the arche–5 is one, moving and apeiron, Anaxi- mander . . . said that the apeiron was the arche– and element of things that are, and he was the first to introduce this name for the arche– \[that is, he was the first to call the arche– apeiron]. (In addition he said that motion is eternal, in which it occurs that the heavens come to be.) He says that the arche– is neither water nor any of the other things called elements, but some other nature which is apeiron, out of which come to be all the heavens and the worlds in them. The things that are perish into the things from which they come to be, according to necessity, for they pay penalty and retribu- tion to each other for their injustice in accor- dance with the ordering of time, as he says in rather poetical language.

- *Aperion* = (originating stuff) of the cosmos. Something indefinite. It later came to mean "infinite"
> The apeiron gives rise to something productive of hot and cold, but Anaximander does not say what this “something productive of hot and cold” is. The hot takes the form of fire, the origin of the sun and the other heavenly bodies; while the cold is a dark mist that can be transformed into air and earth. Both air and earth are originally moist, but become drier because of the fire.  
- In this way, Anaximander disagreed with Thales about arche being water 
- Hiedegger, Hegel, and Nietzhche use Anazmanders definition 
	- Neitzche calls Anaximander a pessimist since Anaximander thinks that there is a phenomenon that cannnot be known 
	- According to Hegel 
		> The advance made by the determination of the principle as infinite in comprehensiveness rests in the fact that absolute essence no longer is a simple universal, but one which negates the finite. At the same time, viewed from the material side, Anaximander removes the individuality of the element of water ; his objective principle does not appear to be material. and it may be understood as Thought. (Hegel’s History of Philosophy: Greek Philosophy)
