- A correct approach to the national question can bring a movement up or down
	- The key is to take a negative approach to national question
- The history of the Jewish and Palestinian people is the realm in which me must come to a materialist conclusion, not acamdeic theories or ideas. 
	- The palestinian quesiton must be dealt with in the particular 
- Decolonization is not a real or valid point in the question of Palestine. 


### The Jewish Question and the National Question
- The Jewish people throughout history (mostly in Europe) have been an opressed caste of society 
- 1897 - World Zionist Organization 
	- Adopted a manifesto for the Jewish state
	- Denied the coexistnce of the jewish working class
- The Bund 
	- Although they were a faction of the RSLDP, there was an insistence of the need for an indepetnt Jewish working class of the country 
	- Bundist antizionism was the weakest form of anti zionism because it was isolationist 
- Socialism/internationalism not Zionism was the main popular pov for the Jewish peoples during the October revolution

### The Bolshevik Revolutionary Foreign Policy 
- One of the slogans of the Bolsheciks ewas no more secret treatese 
- Trotsky lebretsnikov 
- Sights-pico accords 
- 1924 Palestine Communsit Party is recognized by the international 
	- Formed by Jewish Israelis with some arabs 
		- Ordered to Arabize the party (done in a zinoviest way)
		- This created a lot of problems, politically the best ejwsih communist came to the conclsion that there very presence in palestine was just a step in the Zionist project

### The Trade Union Question 
- The Palestine commusnt partys stance was that of a single state with both Jewish and Palestinians 
- in the 1940s there were a series of strikes and an attempt to buil d a trade union that would unite Plaestinian and Jewish workers
- The zionists pushed for a reactionary strike breaking rules under "hebrew labour" this divided the working class 
	- The Jewish workers saw this as a basic betrayal of solidarity priniciples and there was an isntinct of solidairty during the class struggle. Samy Dohal 

### Betrayal of Stalinism to the Palestinian people 
- As the Nakba was going on the soviet embassador of the UN was ordeed by stalin to vote against partition (against the palestinain communsit)
	- The soviet union was the first country to recognize Israel 
- Stalin has the soviet unoin vote for partition and armed the zionist militias 

### Black Septmeber 1970 
- The PFLP (the communst organization amongst palestinians (maoist))
	- Attemped a kind of coup in Jordan
		- They surrounded the King of Jordan's Mercedes shot it up with no fatality
		- This sparked black september 

### The Antifada 
- Hamas made gains on the antifada, but they recieved money and permits from the occupying forces
	- Why would the occupation forces do this? Its because they saw that the socialist Fattah were a lot more dangerous than the right wing extremists (*in the same way that the americans funded the Taliban*)

### The Oslo Accords
- The Plaestinian Authority was given the trappings of a state, a plice force, no border control 
- There are tens of thousands of aplestinains that communte to israel everyday
- Fattah did not represent palestinans after the Oslo accord, moreso year after year

- 2007: The only alternative to Fattah was hamas
	- Palestinains didnt vote for Hamas because they are antisemetic, its because it was a protest vote against Fattah 

### The March of Return 
- Palesitnans starting in Gaza and then in lebanon 
- Palestinains would walk up to the fence by the thousands every week 
	- The represented a desire to tear those walls down
	- This was a physical representation of waht the occupation has become (open air prisons like ghettos)


### How to end the Israeli Apartheid 
- On the BDS movement 
	- We have power as workers not power as a consumer: Thats a capitalist lie! 
	- Divestment: Who are we askingn to divest? 
		- We are asking multi-million dollar companies to divest from Israel
		- We cannot ask the bourgoise to resolve the question in palestine
	- Sanctions: 
		- Are they going to apply sanctions? No, these are bougoise governments
	- This doesnt mean that people in the BDS movement aren't allies
		- This is a question of method
		- We will defend BDS while remaining our critiques of their method
#### Methods
- workers boycots
	- Workers at the ports who are shipping arms to israel strike against sending them 
	- BDS has gained the support from unions, but they do not have workers boycot in place
		- They are telling their workers not to buy products (not enough!! )
	- Palestine will be free through class struggle methods
		- This is not just a question for palesine in isreal, we have a revolutoinary duty o the palestinians to undergo a revolution here

###
- There is enormous amounts of poverty in Isreal, there is a brewing class struggle since the 90s and has only gotten worse since
	- Quesiton: nationalism amongst the workers ?? 
		- Answer: There are many who are poisoned with naitonalism BUT overtime this will dissipate with the growing class struggle
- Solution: Socialist Federation of the entire middle east 
	- Would it be a federation of two republics? Would it be a single republic like the original views of the PCP? No one can be sure
