Merry Christmas comrades! 
- The attitude of marxists to religion is an important and interesting one. There are a lot of people, even supporters of the IMT who are liberation theologists or those who consider themselves islamic marxists.

##### What marxists want 
- The point of this leadoff is to give a materialist understanding of what religion is, where it comes from historically, its role in society and lastly our attitude towards it. Firstly, we must reiterate what the role of marxists are:
	- The aim of all socialists is the transformation of society 
	- This aim, anticapitalism can be expressed by all people, and we would welcome every progressive person in our struggle irrespective of their religious beleifs
	- With that being said, as a tendency with the expressed purpose of being the tool of the revolutionary masses, we must commit to a strong programme. Marxism, or Scientific Socialism
- There is a very famous quote that comrades not well read on religion will know. Some have probably heard it used in a argument to show Marx was hostile to religion- i.e. that religion is the "opium of the masses". There is a reason why people who believe atheism should be entered into socialist program don't repeat the quote in full: 
	- "Religious suffering is at one at the same time the expression of real suffering and protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of souless conditions. It is the opium of the people". 
		- What does this mean? Dulls your experience of the real world, but the main reason people resort to opium is the real suffering of their life (either mental or phsyical)
		- Religion is not some nasty trick created by the ruling class... In contrast, it has a material basis in society and stems from the opressed layers.

#### Philosophical materialism and Science
- From the materialist and scientific understanding of the world, the existence of any supernatural entity is not in the realm of possibility. Marxists place nature and the material world as primary. 
- Modern scientific knowledge is, out of no coincidence, completely in line with this. Taking creationism as an example, even looking at the human genome it is easy to come to the conclusion that humans are not a creature unique to earth.
	- So why do people believe in religion? Where does it come from?

#### Life After Death 
- Religion gives consolation to men and women in their fears about death. By offering an afterlife, humans become de facto immortal. 
- Furthermore, not only are religious people offered another life, it includes all that is absent from our lives on earth. There is no mystery in who the promises of an afterlife were awarded to- oftentimes the poorest and those with the least. I remember in catholic school in toronto learning "the meek shall inherit the earth". 
- In this way, religion can act as a hope mechanism for a better life. 
- The basis for life after death is the immaterial soul, but as marxsits we understand that without material life would be nothing like how it is. All of our sensations, our pleasures, our perceptions and thoughts cannot be seperated form our body. 
--- 
#### Pessimistic conclusion? 
- Some might argue that the materialist conception of life and death is pessimistic, but when you look at what believeing in an afterlife achieves, marxsits would argue differently
- When you believe that the life we have on earth is the only one we'll see, leaving it for future generations - the task to create a better world are as strong as can be. Further, believing that a heavenly afterlife will come can act as a form of demoralization and worse, demobalize those who are opressed from fighting abck against those who make their life on earth a living hell. 
- In this way, the materialist conception is action optimistic, with meaning stemming from the desire to make this life better for all.

#### Origins of Religion - Christianity 
- I will be talking about christianity, mostly because the material on the marxist view of religion uses Christianity as its main example. This is more of a question of resoruces, thoguh if people have questions about other religions it can be a great topic of discussion.
- Christianity as a popularized religion first came out of Judea, a conquered state of the Roman empire. It did not come into being by accident. 
	- The roman empire required slaves for its production of goods. Of course its was not a homogenous system, but slave labour and peasant labour differ in a few key ways which link to the rise of chrisitanity in Rome. 
	- Slave society is not a productive form of class society. Compared to the peasants which existed prior, the slave would need less to survive and therefore would produce more surpluce relative to the price of subsitence. This lead Rome to conquer more and more territoty in finding more slaves for work. 
	- Judea was one of these terretories, and as such a lot of the people were subjugated and oppressed by Rome, and saw little way out. Every economic system will resolve its internal contradictions in a matter of time, comrades have probably heard of the famous slaves revolts and sparticus. There were peasant revolts in Ancient Rome as well. Except the peasants and the slaves were often used to repress the other during these times of revolution. Even if there was no revolution that lead to a seizure of power, the contradictions need to resolve themself somehow. In its place was a sort of religious revolution. 
- As Engels explains in his *Origins of Early Christianity*, there are many similarities between the origins of christianity and the socialist workers movement. For one, both are movements of opressed peoples, full of slaves and those deprived of all rights, displaced or subjugated from ancienent rome. 
- Religion is as old as class society, both chrisitianity and islam were revolutionary movements form the poor and opressed
	- Christianity places the salvation of life in death, while socialists offer it on Earth. Both are persicuted and despite it, seem to go stronger and stronger at the face of said persecution. 
- The similarities extend so much so that Engels names socialism as "Dominant" in early christianity: 
- If you read the Acts of the Apostles *book 5 of the new Testament 
> "And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things in common......Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, And laid them down at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need." (Acts, 4:32)

> St. Ambrose: "Nature furnishes its wealth to all men in common. God beneficently hascreated all things that their enjoyment be common to all living beings, and that the earth become the common possession of all. It is Nature itself that has given birth to the right of the community, whilst it is only unjust usurpation that has created the right of
- Jesus often helped the poor and dispossesed, attacked the rich
- The same can be said for other religions, especially Islam and Buddhism. Although Marx Engels or Lenin didn't write anything on Islam, it was a great topic of discourse in the early soviet union, until the rise of stalinism where the dominant line was that there is no relationship between communism and islam. 
- It should be noted that this "communism" although an acheivement at the time, was limited by the material conditions of the soceity. 
	- There was not the capacity of the productive workers, nor were there workers in the modern day sense present to even express the ideas of a workers state
- Even if the primitive comminism practiced by the early christians was premature, it was still repressed by the Roman Empire. It represented a threat to the existing ruling order. By the time of Constantine, it was agknowledged that the state could not defeat religion, but rather than it would have to join it to remain in its subjugation of the religious slaves. 
	- At the Nicean council for example, the church was met in luxury. The leadership caste of the chruch, i.e. Bishops came under the pressure of the ruling class and left the communist traditions of their predecessors. 
	- Before this, christians would not recognize the state, serve in its army, as they would follow god above, from this point forward god and the state became entangled. 
	- Since the council of Nicea, the church and the rich have become firm allies.

#### The corruption of the church to the ruling class 
- The corruption of the church, and their shifting away from the former communist beliefs into what benefited the state can be related to the abandonment of the trade union leadership of their workers to the union leadership. 
- This also meant that defying the state would end up with punishment from the chruch (excommunicaiton and eternal damnation)
- One of the most obvious offences by the church and display of their complete corruption was Pope Leo the 10ths Taxa Camarae which preyed off of those who were scared by the afterlife: 
- In the year 1517, Pope Leo X launched the Taxa Camerae, in order to sell indulgences whereby one's soul could be saved for a modest sum of money 
	- You could pay a price to absolve you of incest, rape, infanticide, and murder
	- But more expensive than all of these is if you hold different ideas to those of the Church (i.e. a heretic)

- The question we must be asking ourselves isn't whether god exists or not, but rather *how* we will change the world we live in the now
