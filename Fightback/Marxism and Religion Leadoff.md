Merry Christmas comrades! 
- The attitude of marxists to religion is an important and interesting one. There are a lot of people, even supporters of the IMT who are liberation theologists or those who consider themselves islamic marxists. Personally I've been asked by contacts about our stance on religion, I hope that this leadoff will give comrades the idea required to explain our stance.
---
##### What marxists want 
- The point of this leadoff is to give a materialist understanding of what religion is, where it comes from historically, its role in society and lastly our attitude towards it. Firstly though, we must reiterate what the role of marxists are:
	- The aim of all socialists is the transformation of society 
	- This aim, anticapitalism - can be expressed by all people, and we would welcome every progressive person in our struggle irrespective of their religious beleifs
	- With that being said, the IMT is a tendency with the expressed purpose of being the tool of the revolutionary masses, we must commit to a strong programme. Marxism, or Scientific Socialism
- There is a very famous quote that comrades not well read on religion will know. Some have probably heard it used in a argument to show Marx was hostile to religion- i.e. that religion is the "opium of the masses". There is a reason why people who believe atheism should be entered into socialist program don't repeat the quote in full: 
	- "Religious suffering is at one at the same time the expression of real suffering and protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of souless conditions. It is the opium of the people". 
		- What does this mean? Dulls your experience of the real world, but the main reason people resort to opium is the real suffering of their life (either mental or phsyical)
		- Religion is not some nasty trick created by the ruling class... In contrast, it has a material basis in society and stems from the opressed layers.

#### Philosophical materialism and Science
- From the materialist and scientific understanding of the world, the existence of any supernatural entity is not in the realm of possibility. Marxists place nature and the material world as primary. 
- Modern scientific knowledge is, out of no coincidence, completely in line with this. Taking creationism as an example, even looking at the human genome it is easy to come to the conclusion that humans are not a creature unique to earth.
	- So why do people believe in religion? Where does it come from? 

---
#### Life After Death 
- Religion gives consolation to men and women in their fears about death. By offering an afterlife, humans become de facto immortal. 
- Furthermore, not only are religious people offered another life, it includes all that is absent from our lives on earth. There is no mystery in who the promises of an afterlife were awarded to- oftentimes the poorest and those with the least. I remember in catholic school in toronto learning "the meek shall inherit the earth". 
- In this way, religion can act as a hope mechanism for a better life. 
- The basis for life after death is the immaterial soul, but as marxsits we understand that without material life would be nothing like how it is. All of our sensations, our pleasures, our perceptions and thoughts cannot be seperated form our body. 
--- 
#### Pessimistic conclusion? 
- Some might argue that the materialist conception of life and death is pessimistic, but when you look at what believeing in an afterlife achieves, marxsits would argue differently
- When you believe that the life we have on earth is the only one we'll see, leaving it for future generations - the task to create a better world are as strong as can be. Further, believing that a heavenly afterlife will come can act as a form of demoralization and worse, demobalize those who are opressed from fighting abck against those who make their life on earth a living hell. 
- In this way, the materialist conception is action optimistic, with meaning stemming from the desire to make this life better for all.

#### Origins of Religion - Christianity 
- I will be talking about christianity, mostly because the material on the marxist view of religion uses Christianity as its main example. This is more of a question of resoruces, thoguh if people have questions about other religions it can be a great topic of discussion.
- Christianity as a popularized religion first came out of Judea, a conquered state of the Roman empire. It did not come into being by accident. 
	- The roman empire required slaves for its production of goods. Of course its was not a homogenous system, but slave labour and peasant labour differ in a few key ways which link to the rise of chrisitanity in Rome. 
	- Slave society is not a productive form of class society. Compared to the peasants which existed prior, the slave would need less to survive and therefore would produce more surpluce relative to the price of subsitence. This lead Rome to conquer more and more territoty in finding more slaves for work. 
	- Judea was one of these terretories, and as such a lot of the people were subjugated and oppressed by Rome, and saw little way out. Every economic system will resolve its internal contradictions in a matter of time, comrades have probably heard of the famous slaves revolts and sparticus. There were peasant revolts in Ancient Rome as well. Except the peasants and the slaves were often used to repress the other during these times of revolution. Even if there was no revolution that lead to a seizure of power, the contradictions need to resolve themself somehow. In its place was a sort of religious revolution. 
- As Engels explains in his *Origins of Early Christianity*, there are many similarities between the origins of christianity and the socialist workers movement. For one, both are movements of opressed peoples, full of slaves and those deprived of all rights, displaced or subjugated from ancienent rome. 
- Religion is as old as class society, both chrisitianity and islam were revolutionary movements form the poor and opressed
	- Christianity places the salvation of life in death, while socialists offer it on Earth. Both are persicuted and despite it, seem to go stronger and stronger at the face of said persecution. 
- The similarities extend so much so that Engels names socialism as "Dominant" in early christianity: 
- If you read the Acts of the Apostles *book 5 of the new Testament 
> "And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things in common......Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, And laid them down at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need." (Acts, 4:32)

> St. Ambrose: "Nature furnishes its wealth to all men in common. God beneficently hascreated all things that their enjoyment be common to all living beings, and that the earth become the common possession of all. It is Nature itself that has given birth to the right of the community, whilst it is only unjust usurpation that has created the right of
- Jesus often helped the poor and dispossesed, attacked the rich
- The same can be said for other religions, especially Islam and Buddhism. Although Marx Engels or Lenin didn't write anything on Islam, it was a great topic of discourse in the early soviet union, until the rise of stalinism where the dominant line was that there is no relationship between communism and islam. 
- It should be noted that this "communism" although an acheivement at the time, was limited by the material conditions of the soceity. 
	- There was not the capacity of the productive workers, nor were there workers in the modern day sense present to even express the ideas of a workers state
- Even if the primitive comminism practiced by the early christians was premature, it was still repressed by the Roman Empire. It represented a threat to the existing ruling order. By the time of Constantine, it was agknowledged that the state could not defeat religion, but rather than it would have to join it to remain in its subjugation of the religious slaves. 
	- At the Nicean council for example, the church was met in luxury. The leadership caste of the chruch, i.e. Bishops came under the pressure of the ruling class and left the communist traditions of their predecessors. 
	- Before this, christians would not recognize the state, serve in its army, as they would follow god above, from this point forward god and the state became entangled. 
	- Since the council of Nicea, the church and the rich have become firm allies.

#### The corruption of the church to the ruling class 
- The corruption of the church, and their shifting away from the former communist beliefs into what benefited the state can be related to the abandonment of the trade union leadership of their workers to the union leadership. 
- This also meant that defying the state would end up with punishment from the chruch (excommunicaiton and eternal damnation)
- One of the most obvious offences by the church and display of their complete corruption was Pope Leo the 10ths Taxa Camarae which preyed off of those who were scared by the afterlife: 
- In the year 1517, Pope Leo X launched the Taxa Camerae, in order to sell indulgences whereby one's soul could be saved for a modest sum of money 
	- You could pay a price to absolve you of incest, rape, infanticide, and murder
	- But more expensive than all of these is if you hold different ideas to those of the Church (i.e. a heretic)
---
- The question we must be asking ourselves isn't whether god exists or not, but rather *how* we will change the world we live in the now
## Religion and revolution 
- Fast forward 1000 years, religion changed its role as the economic basis of society changed, and it actually had a big role to play in the bourgeois revolutions. In feudalism the Church was an intrinsic part of the state and a major landowner, and a bulwark against progress. The rise of the bourgeoisie came under the guise of a religious movement. In response to repression the rising bourgeois turned to Protestantism, you can see this in Luther’s theses. The main difference between the Catholicism and Protestantism is their beliefs in salvation. Catholics believe in salvation by works while protestants profess salvation by faith. What this meant in practice is that in the Catholic Church you could pay a price to absolve you of sins such as incest, rape, murder, and infanticide (as an aside, the most expensive sin of all was heresy, which shows you where the Churches priorities lie). Therefore, the first stirrings against feudalism was actually a challenge to this power and authority that the church had over salvation itself, and this found an echo in the masses. Protestantism reflected the revolt of the nascent bourgeoisie against decaying feudalism.
- But there were class differences in this movement as well. The left wing of the movement had a communistic tendency, best exhibited by Thomas Muntzer and the Anabaptists in Germany. Muntzer called upon the peasants to rise up against the aristocracy, but Luther allied himself with the aristocracy and slaughtered the peasant uprising.
#### English revolution 
- These class distinctions can be seen in the English Revolution as well. The Anglican Church was the right wing of this movement, while the masses of poor people stood with the independents led by Cromwell, who were the left wing. There was an even a further left wing who were communists themselves, like the Levellers. While Cromwell’s soldiers thought they were fighting against privilege and for freedom, the Levellers went even further, wanting to abolish private property itself.

- We can see in these examples that there are always two Churches, the Church of the ruling class, and the Church of the revolutionary masses. There are two gods: the reactionary God of the ruling class, and the revolutionary God of the labouring masses.
#### french revolution
- By the time of the french revolution, things had changed. Religion was not on the minds of the masses as their consciousness grew past the need. After the revolution, religion practically dissapeared in france. 
- As comrades will remember from past leadoffs, duing the russian revolution, religion also played a small or absent role. At the beginning in 1905 it was lead by Father Gapone but after the massacre it was lead by the marxists. Religion before the revolution in russia also played a reactionary role insofar as it was tied to the tsarist bureacracy. The workers understood this and did away with religion when they took up arms. However, during the stalinist degeneration, because of the poor conditions the consciousness of the workers was thrown back, into nationalism, anti-semitism, sperstition and naturally religion as well. 
---
#### Lenin on party and religion 
- So, how should the state respond to religion, then? 
- This was a question that had to be answered in Russia. There were members of the party, atheist, who saw the reactionary capacity of religion and that along with historical developement there would be no need for religion. 
- Lenin wrote in 1905, however: 
> "The state must not concern itself with religion; religious societies must not be bound to the state. Everyone must be free to profess whatever religion he likes, or to profess no religion, i.e., to be an atheist, as every Socialist usually is."

- The party's view for religion as it related to the individual and the state is different to the party line. Lenin continues with "The party of the proletariat demands that the state shall declare religion a private matter, but it does not for a moment regard the question of a fight against the opium of the people - the fight against religious superstition, etc., - as a private matter. The opportunists have so distorted the question as to make it appear that the Social Democratic _Party_regards religion as a private matter.
	- This is a show of Lenins flexibility yet firm stance/grasp of marxist philsophy and bolshivik organizing. It is not a contradiction to regard the party as fighting against the "opium of the masses" while understanding the it is not the state which will be able to erase religion from the masses
	- As we have seen thousands of years ago even, trying to get rid of religion by the sword will do exactly what you don't want. Its kind of like a hydra in that sense. Of course, this didn't stop later stalinist government bureacracies trying to complete ban religion in the name of progress. Maybe this can be a topic of discussion though. 
---
#### The future of religion 
- Understanding the developement and the role of religion in class society will lead you to the correct conclusion that a state banning religion is not the way it will leave society. 
- The roots of religion are entrenched in the conditions of the working class. As Lenin argued in "On Religion" no amount of reading by the masses will rid superstition and religion. The only way religion will dissapear in society is if the oppresed unite and fight against the social forces which breed religion to begin with. To put it succinctly- " _until they learn to fight against the rule of the capitalist in all its forms_"
- On the question of the future of religion, there will be obviosu disigreement between marxists and Chrisitians and other religions. Marxists don't have a crystal ball and cannot explain the future accordingliny. And although I've described that Marxism is philisophically incompatable with religion, it is no question that we are opposed to the idea of prohibiting religion. 
- What we do argue though, is that there should be a complete seperation beween chruch and state. he churches must not be supported directly or indirectly out of taxation, nor should religion be taught in state schools. If people want religion, they should maintain their churches exclusively through the contributions of the congregation and preach their doctrines in their own time. The same basic observations hold good for Islam or any other religion.
- Our understanding of religion and it's place in soceity comes from the historical fact that religion has been used by the exploiters to decieve and enslave the masses. This is recongnized by workers and the masses throughout history in the many revolts against the church and state. Christians and other religious people dissatisfied by their position in society and power and unjust exploiters often fermant into revolutionary pontential. This is the basis of Liberation Theology which is present throughout the world, as comrades are probably most familiar with latin america, but also america, south asia and the middle east. AS I alluded to earleir for examples, there is the proclivity for some muslims to call for things like "islamic socialism" since the 1940s. 
- It is revolutionary marxism which has the capability to join the forces of the working class together to fight the common enemy in capitalist soceity. Marxists call for the fruitful and necessary collaboration between Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus etc etc in the struggle to to transform society. 
> This is why we open our arms to all religious workers who want to fight oppression. And we have infinitely more in common with the liberation theologists then we do with liberal bourgeois types like Richard Dawkins. A collaboration between Marxists and religious people in the struggle to transform society is necessary, despite our philosophical differences. To quote Camilo Torres, a Colombian priest and liberation theologist “I have cast off the priest's habit in order to become a real priest. It is the duty of every Catholic to be a revolutionary; it is the duty of every revolutionary to carry out the revolution. The Catholic who is not a revolutionary is living in mortal sin." Or there is also the Brazilian Bishop, Helder Camara: “when I feed the poor, they say I am a saint, when I ask why thet are poor, they say I am a communist”. It is unity with people like this that we will build a new society free from oppression, exploitation, and poverty.

#### Religion and the crisis of capitalism 
- Religion to marxists can be described as a sort of "false consciousness", it has the ability to push people to look elsewhere when staring at the face of opression dead in the eyes.
- In class society, "love thy neighbour" has a hollow meaning, under the market, morality in inexistant. The only way in which we can create a world thats not dog-eat-dog is the communal ownership of the means of production. One way in which marxists and the religions are aligned with in each other. 
---
#### For a paradise in the world (Conclusion)
- As a marxist I do have faith, not in god but in the strenght of the working class. Stemming from a scientific understanding of their power in history and modern day. The ability of the working class to create the conditions of a world where no religion isnecessary will not come right after the revolution, but it will come one day. Its not a paradise in the life after ours that we are fighting for, its a paradise on earth right now. This is what the IMT is set out and capable of doing. With that being said, I hope we can have a great discussion.
