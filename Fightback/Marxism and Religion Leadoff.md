Merry Christmas comrades! 
- The attitude of marxists to religion is an important and interesting one. There are a lot of people, even supporters of the IMT who are liberation theologists or those who consider themselves islamic marxists.

##### What marxists want 
- The point of this leadoff is to give a materialist understanding of what religion is, where it comes from historically, its role in society and lastly our attitude towards it. Firstly, we must reiterate what the role of marxists are:
	- The aim of all socialists is the transformation of society 
	- This aim, anticapitalism can be expressed by all people, and we would welcome every progressive person in our struggle irrespective of their religious beleifs
	- With that being said, as a tendency with the expressed purpose of being the tool of the revolutionary masses, we must commit to a strong programme. Marxism, or Scientific Socialism

#### Philisophical materialism and Science
- From the materialist and sceintific understanding of the world, the existence of any supernatural enitity is not in the realm of possibility. Marxists place nature and the material world as primary. 
- Modern scienctific knoweldge is, out of no coincidence, completely in line with this. Taking creationism as an example, even looking at the human genome it is easy to come to the conclusion that humans are not a creature unique to earth.
	- So why do people believe in religion? Where does it come from?

#### Life After Death 
- Religion gives consolation to men and women in their fears about death. By offering an afterlife, humans become de facto immortal. 
- Furthermore, not only are religious people offered another life, it includes all that is absent from our lives on earth. There is no mystery in who the promises of an afterlife were awarded to- oftentimes the poorest and those with the least. I remember in catholic school in toronto learning "the meek shall inherit the earth". 
- In this way, religion can act as a hope mechanism for a better life. 
- The basis for life after death is the immaterial soul, but as marxsits we understand that without material life would be nothing like how it is. All of our sensations, our pleasures, our perceptions and thoughts cannot be seperated form our body.

#### Pessimistic conclusion? 
- Some might argue that the materialist conception of lfie and death is pessimistic

- The question we must be asking ourselves isn't whether god exists or not, but rather *how* we will change the world we live in the now
