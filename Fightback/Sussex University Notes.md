### Introduction
- The writings from the Youth Bulletins of britain should not be seen as a recipe or a cookbook 
	- This bulletin should not be seen as a cookbook for youth work, because no such thing exists. Instead it contains ad- vice and guidance, based on the experi- ence of many comrades over many years. We can use this to develop our youth work on a higher level in the future. Everything in this bulletin must be read with one thing in mind above all else: the need to recruit to and build the IMT.
- We might find some of these points useful and continue the traditions in reading the youth bulleitns
- Together they clearly explain the difference between the Marxist approach to youth work, and a petty-bourgeois studentist approach.

### Allan Woods goes to Susses (early 1960s)
- Sussex: 
	- The work in Sussex University is important because it was the first time the Tendency carried out systematic student work. It also played a crucial role in building the forces of Militant. This experience therefore deserves some attention.
	- The Bulletins are from the 1960s and the context must be taken into consideration. The Tory pary had been in power for 13 years and was completely discredited. There were two large strikes at the time Allan woods started school, on campus CND attracted a  lot of students, as well as the Anti-Aparthied.
- The state of the organisation 
	- No more than ab 30 people in the whole country 
	- No money, no full timer, no centre, and nothing but a small black and white 4 page paper called Socialist Fight
	- The group did have one thing though, that other groups didn't have. The ideas of marxism, the correct perspectives, and correct methods of orientation that that I will later get into. I should add there were also some mistakes, ones which would be payed for and learned from through this presentation I hope! 
- What was learned from Allan Wood's experience at sussex? 
	- "Our experience in Sussex shows that it is possible to win and train students from a middle class background in such a way that they do not leave the movement"
- This is a very important question. It is essential to GET PEOPLE ACTIVELY INVOLVED in the work of building the organization. People like to be involved, doing things – and everybody is capable of doing SOMETHING. It is up to us to find out what that something is and encourage them to do it.

#### The paper 
- Allan Woods set up a paper at Sussex called Perspectives. On his own initiative (which was definetly not the procedure), he decided to do i tafter reading Lenin's where to begin. The main text that is used to create leadoffs on the role of the revolutionary press in Fightback most often. 
- Woods recognized the essential role of getting people involved and although not many people wanted to write entire articles, agreed to help in other ways. 
- At one point he even stopped a comrade on his way to the library, asked if he knew anything about Rhodesia. After the comrade shook his head "no" Allan woods said "Well now is your chance to find out!"
- The whole paper was a bit overambitious, a lot of the articles weren't that good, full of grammatical errors. Sometimes the results were even comical, for example when Ted Grant had to explain to Allan woods (after reading trotsky's transitional programme) that "FOR A LABOUR GOVERNMENT! FOR A WORKERS’ DICTATORSHIP!" was not a very good transitional demand. 

#### The sit in - Student politics
- Im going to focus specifically on a story relaitng to student politics, I think comrades who worked with student politics at concordia will find it useful, or at least the similarities of petty bourgoise students reassuring. 
- 1969: In Allan wood's final year there was a great period of ferment amongst the students, who were inspired by what happened in france in may 1968. 
- There was a rule in the Militant at the time, a strict one that comrades in their final year of schooling should not participate in the work out of fear of not passing their classes.
	- Trotsky once said: if you a worker, you should be the best worker, if you are a soldier you should be the best soldier. The same should apply to Marxist students.
- Witht that being said there 
- The demands
- The adventurism 
- On convincing people 
	- It is a sad fact of life that Marxists are   not born, nor do they grow on trees. We must be able to convince people, and this demands two things: first a good political level and secondly, a patient attitude to people with other views. If you do not succeed at first, do not write somebody off because they argue against you. AN- SWER THE ARGUMENTS.
- On how to interact with people: 
	- One other important point: when arguing with someone with a different view, always start by SEEKING THE COM- MON GROUND. We should not say NO, but rather YES, BUT. That way, you get people thinking, questioning their own assumptions.

### Conclusion
