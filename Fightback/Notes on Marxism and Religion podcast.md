- "Religious suffering is at one at the same time the expression of real suffering and protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of souless conditions. It is the opium of the people". 
	- What does this mean? Dulls your experience of the real world, but the main reason people resort to opium is the real suffering of their life (either mental or phsyical)
	- Religion is not some nasty trick created by the ruling class... In contrast, it has a material basis in society and stems from the opressed layers. 

- On slave society: 
	- Slave society is not a productive form of class society, looking at ancent rome for example, slaves were tools with voices. Compared to the peasants which existed prior, the slave would need less to survive and therefore would produce more surpluce relative to the price of subsitence. This lead Rome to conquer more and more territoty in finding more slaves for work. 

- In place of a revolution, there was a religious revolution (religious strengthening during that time)
	- reflected deep social needs that existed
	- "ridicouled as a religion of slaves and women"
	- Judea first emerged in a conquered province of rome
