The COVID-19 pandemic hit an already struggling population and drove millions of Canadians into unemployment and a more precarious life, forcing tens of thousands into homelessness. For many, life on the street comes with a death sentence.

According to [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2021001/article/00002-eng.htm), more than 235,000 people experience homelessness in any given year, and 25,000 to 35,000 people may be experiencing homelessness on any given night.

This is surely to be a low estiamate, as there is not only very few cities in Canada where estiamtes are being taken, a lot of the surveys are conucted by volunteers and such. 

One of the main causes of death is overdose, this should be understood as a consequence of the ongong opiod epidemic in canada and as a coping mechanism for those in poverty. 

#### What caused this surge in homeslessness? 
One source of this surge in homelessness can be found in the rising cost of housing hitting Canadians across the country. A [national report](https://rentals.ca/national-rent-report) on rent prices in 2022 states that rent has risen 12.4 per cent over the last year with no sign of slowing down, with a 4.9 per cent increase over the last three months of that year. Rent has risen the fastest for the most expensive cities, with Vancouver and Toronto rents up 24.3 per cent and 23.7 per cent, respectively.

The governemnt has done little in spite of this.  The federal 2022 budget included [plans to invest](https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2022/04/20/making-housing-more-affordable-canadians) $4 billion to ”help create 100,000 new housing units over the next five years”. How these units will be created is entirely unclear, and the problem is not simply a lack of housing.

There are 1.3 million empty homes in Canada! With the soaring rental prices and homelessness do we see the complete lack of ability for the capitalist system to offer workers anything. Along with the fact that the world produces more food than we need yet there is so much starvation and high food prices, its one of the main arguments one could use for the necessity of the planned economy not only in Canada but Internationally. 

as the article points out: 
>  As long as housing is allowed to be used for the profit of the ruling class, there will be no interest on their part in housing the homeless. Housing should be a basic human right. However, capitalism puts the rights of corporations to make profits before the rights or even lives of the less fortunate.


Not only is capitalism and the current capitlaist system (i.e. CEOs, stakeholders, governemnts, instituinal bodies etc) responsible for the homelessness crisis right now... We should call whats happening what it is: Social murder. 

>_When one individual inflicts bodily injury upon another such that death results, we call the deed manslaughter; when the assailant knew in advance that the injury would be fatal, we call his deed murder. But when society places hundreds of proletarians in such a position that they inevitably meet a too early and an unnatural death, one which is quite as much a death by violence as that by the sword or bullet; when it deprives thousands of the necessaries of life, places them under conditions in which they cannot live – forces them, through the strong arm of the law, to remain in such conditions until that death ensues which is the inevitable consequence – knows that these thousands of victims must perish, and yet permits these conditions to remain, its deed is murder just as surely as the deed of the single individual; disguised, malicious murder, murder against which none can defend himself, which does not seem what it is, because no man sees the murderer, because the death of the victim seems a natural one, since the offense is more one of omission than of commission. But murder it remains._

There are so many other examples of social murder under the capitalist ssytem that goes unspoken about everyday. Now is a better time than every to be a osiclaist. With that mainstream media calls "radical" pejoratively to refer to the left and protestors and dissedents of the systems, the real burtality exists in the poeple which hold it up. 

This is why we call for: 

**Seize all empty properties!**

**Expropriate the property development firms and run them under workers’ control!**

**Housing for all!**
