### Main Argument 

> § 1 · There is a science which investigates being as being and the attributes which belong to this in virtue of its own nature. Now this is not the same as any of the so-called special sciences; for none of these others deals generally with being as being. They cut off a part of being and investigate the attributes of this part—this is what the mathematical sciences for instance do.

- A science that investigates being qua being (being as being) (what it means for being to exist)
- This science differs from the rest of the sciences that takes for granted being qua being to analyse the atrtibutes of being. 
	- Math for instance does not study being as such
