> If you believe that things of kind X exist, then you are a metaphysical realist about things of kind X 

- There are two types of *abstract identities* that are people can be metaphysical realists about
	1. Universals: Properties, relations, kinds
		- things that are not particulars. Blueness in this bottle vs the idea of blue 
		- Universals are repeatable 
	1. Abstract entities: numbers, sets, concepts, etc 
- **Platonic Realism**: If two objects are blue, its is because they share and exemplify the property of blueness 
	- The "Equal" itself, the "Beautiful" itself
