Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: meaningful! [^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code. Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote. `{ my code }` Add as many paragraphs as you like.


You can also use inline footnotes. ^[notice that the caret goes outside of the brackets on this one.]
