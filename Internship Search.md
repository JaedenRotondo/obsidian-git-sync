Things to do: 

Jaeden – Searching for a Fall term will be very competitive so be sure that you are actively applying to postings once your sequence is processed.

I had a quick look at your resume and you have room to make improvements. I suggest you do this while you wait for your sequence to be processed.

Do not use full sentences and pronouns in your resume. 

Your education section should have a list of courses. Do not put course numbers with an explanation of each course.

You are missing a line to list your core competencies for each project and work experience.

You are missing your Interests section.

You have 2 pages for your resume so use them; don’t cram everything into one page and leave off info.
