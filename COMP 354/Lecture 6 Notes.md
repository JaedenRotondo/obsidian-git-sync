## Software engineering principles (SEP)
- Software engineering does not have the same number of principles as classical engineering or mathemetics, this has to do with the maturity of the field 
- There is a difference between principles and tools, although they are commonly mixed up 
### Principles
-  Principle 1. Separation of Concerns
- Principle 2. Modularity
- Principle 3. Incrementality
- Principle 4. Abstraction
- Principle 5. Generality
