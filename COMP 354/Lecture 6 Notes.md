## Software engineering principles (SEP)
- Software engineering does not have the same number of principles as classical engineering or mathemetics, this has to do with the maturity of the field 
- There is a difference between principles and tools, although they are commonly mixed up 
### Principles
-  Principle 1. Separation of Concerns
	- The principle of separation of concerns suggests that relevant concerns in a given situation (such as solving a given problem) be identified, concerns be separated, and each concern be looked at separately.
- Principle 2. Modularity
	- In simple terms, modularity is the notion of intradependence within a module, and interdependence (or, if stated inversely, independence) between modules [MacCormack, Sturtevant, 2016].
- Principle 3. Incrementality
	- The principle of incrementality characterizes an evolutionary process that proceeds in a stepwise fashion, in approximations of the end-product. The idea is that each approximation is an increment over the previous one.
- Principle 4. Abstraction
	- The principle of abstraction suggests that, in a given context, one should highlight the important/relevant aspects of the problem, and suppress the unimportant/irrelevant aspects of the problem.
- Principle 5. Generality 
	- The principle of generality is based on the premise that there are a number of advantages of generalization:
		- Productivity: A solution to the generic problem can (but not always) take less time and/or effort to develop, and is relatively easier to communicate and understand [Pólya, 1945; Gehtland, Tate, 2004]. (This is known as the Inventor’s Paradox.)
		- Applicability: A generic problem might be more widely applicable than the original, specific problem [Eisner, 2021].
		- Reusability: A solution to a generic problem tends to be more reusable than a solution to the original, specific problem [Ousterhout, 2018, Chapter 6].
- Principle 6. Anticipation of Change (not studied)
- Principle 7. Rigor (not studied) 
- Principle 8. Formality (not studied)
### Scope of SEP
- SEP are relative, subjective and situational 
- SEP are guides, not legal entities or mandates
