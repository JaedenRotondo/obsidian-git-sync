# User Modelling and Personas
---
### Important definitions 
Definition [User] [ISO, 1999]. [A user is] an individual interacting with the [software] system.
Definition [Persona] [ISO/IEC/IEEE, 2012]. [An] archetypical user of a [software] system, based on research into real users of a [software] system.
Definition [User Model]. A user model is a model of a user from the perspective of the software system.

### 6. MOTIVATION FOR USER MODELING
- **Needs**: The purpose of a software system is to satisfy peoples needs 
- **Value**: A large part of the value of a software is based on the users experience with it 
- **Sensitivity**: A software should take into consideraiton its users
- **Understanding**: Users are not homogenous so creating different models can help us from viewing users as a monolith
- **Conciliation**: The set of features in a software is not necesarily the set of users needs

### 13.3. ADVANTAGES OF PERSONA
- A user persona allows for a concrete model of a user
- A persona allows the view of the user to be actively and emplicitly engaged in the software design 
- Personas can lower the cost of user modelling because they create archetypal users instead of all users (unfeasable)
- Persona is not based on introspection but on the input of knowledge of real users, including that on human factors derived from some form of user research (such as interviews). Thus, a persona provides a guarantee that there is a corresponding user.
- Coimmunicativeness: Its a constant reminder of users
- Using personas lessens the chances of created a "self-referential design"
- What goes into a user persona?

#### What are Pain points? 
- **Interaction Pain Points:** These are about inadequate utility and/or usability of the product or service with which a user is interacting.
	- E.g advertisements to be distracting
- **Journey Pain Points**: These are about unpleasant surprises and/or uncertainties experienced by a user while moving from one stage to another in his or her “journey” with respect to a product or service.
	- E.g. the delivery of a product that a user may have ordered takes prohibitively long
- **Relationship Pain Points:** These are about cumulative pain points of a user with regards to the organization responsible for the product or service that the user has used.
	- E.g. inconsistent pricing of identical products, inadequate or untimely customer support, or unsatisfactory execution of the refund policy.

### 20 LIMITATIONS OF USER MODELING
- No gaurantee of success
- Price
- A user model is not a replacement for a real-life user
- Recency: peoples wants and needs change over time
- Definition of User: sometimes its hard to pinpoint who the user is because a lot of technology doesnt require a user
