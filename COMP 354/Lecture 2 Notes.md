# INTRODUCTION TO INTERVIEWS
### Important definitions: 
## MOTIVATION FOR INTERVIEWS (4/5/6)
- Elicitaiton of knowledge: software engineering and human-computer interaction are disciplines with significant anthropological as well as social aspects.
- To Elicite requirements for an application directly 
- To collect information on people’s habits, interaction with technology, or behavior
- To obtain demographic or psychographic information to characterize a population etc etc
- **Purpose:** They can not only collect and verify info but also give insight into domain and user models 
---
### Elements of an interview (7)
- Proximal manner interview: face to face
	- Beneficial because: it allows for understanding of body language, noticing variations of tone and inflection in voice, and building rapport and trust
- non-Proximal manner interview: telephone, instant messaging, etc 
	- Beneficial because it saves time

### There are 3 different models of interviews (8):
1. **Funnel**: The funnel model begins with general questions, and moves towards more specific questions during the course of the interview.
3. **Pyramid**: The pyramid (or cone) model begins with specific questions, and moves towards general questions during the course of the interview.
4. **Hourglass**: The hourglass model is a mixture of the other two alternatives. It begins with general questions, moves to specific questions during the course of the interview, and ends with general questions again.
---
## Structures of Interviews (9):
- The structure of an interview can be based on (a) whether follow-up questions are allowed, and (b) whether interviewee is given the opportunity to explain an answer to a given question.
1. **UNSTRUCTURED INTERVIEW:** 
	- questions are unplanned and formulated as general concerns and interests
	- most questions will be open
	- **Advantages:** You can create a better rapport with the interviewee. Since the interviewee feels free to express themselves there is a higher chance of getting more insight 
	- **Disadvantages:** It requires a realtively experienced interview and its not replicable. could be more time consuming as well 
2. **SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW**
	- In a semi-structured interview, questions are planned, but they are not necessarily asked in the same order as they are listed. The development of the interview can influence the order. This allows for some improvisation and exploration. 
	- **Advantages:** It requires relatively less training and relatively less experienced interviewer because there is a starting point and all points will be covered 
	-  **Disadvantages:** It may not be easy to come-up with the ‘right’ balance of open and closed questions.
3. **STRUCTURED INTERVIEW**
	- In a structured interview, all questions are planned in advance, and all questions are asked in the same order as in the plan. In many ways, a structured interview is similar to a questionnaire-based survey.
	- **Advantages:** Can be performed by an inexperienced interviewer and results can be studied against each other since the questions are the same and closed usually
	- **Disadvantages:** It requires relatively more skill to formulate ‘good’ questions and a rigid format may not be helpful in building a rapport with an interviewee.

## CHALLENGES TO INTERVIEWS (13)
1. **OBJECTIVITY**
	- Interviewee's integrity, past experience, understanding, and predisposition can influence the information obtained in an interview.
	-  To avoid bias, it is important to ask context-free questions and analyze multiple interviews.
	-  The interviewer should avoid proposing answers to the interviewee and be careful not to influence their response with non-verbal reactions.
1. **TIME MANAGEMENT**
	- Answers to some questions may be long
	-  Avoid interrupting interviewee to shorten answers
	-  Don't give interviewee too much time to think about answer
	-  Balance between asking questions, actively listening, and monitoring answered questions.
1. **ABILITY**
	- The ability to be creative and improvise non-pre-determined questions on part of the interviewer is significant.
## Interviewer and Interviewee (15 and 16)
- The interviewer should approach the interview with an attitude that there must be a change in his or her state of knowledge for the better
- The interviewer must also be knowledgable: if else the interviewer might not know if an answer is *symantically* incorrect
	- It also requires certain human qualities, such as empathy, inquisitiveness, and patience.
- Although only 1 interviewer is required, it could be beneifical to have 2 
	- In such a case, one person can ask the questions and focus on the dialogue with the interviewee, and the other person can record the interview
- It is impossible to interview everyone so interviewees are from a "sample frame"
	- There are different types of sampling techniques
	1. **Random Samples:** In this approach, the respondents are chosen in a way that is representative of the population.
	2. **Convenience Samples:** In this approach, the respondents are chosen for practical reasons, such as proximity, cost, and access.
	3. **Snowball Samples:** In this approach, a small group of initial candidates nominate people through friendships, business relationships, and social networks. (This is a kind of crowdsourcing.)
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-01 at 10.55.26 AM.png]] It is common to set e to be 0.01 or 0.05.
- It is reccomended to have only one interviewee during an interview, this allows for the answers to not be skewed due to social factors
## Interview Questions (17) 
- The approach to an interview should be that the interviewer is an apprentice, and the interviewee is an expert
- There are several types of questions that can be asked in an interview 
	- **Contingent Questions**: There are ability speicific, gender specific, language specific, and device specific questions that cannot be asked to everyone, and exists "relative" to the interviewee
		- Contignent questions are conditional, meaning that they are only asked based on waht the user answered with prior 
		- E.g. Do you use DOS or Windows Explorer to compile your programs?
	- **OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS**
		- An open-ended question is a question that has unbounded range of responses
		- Advantages: It may be in some cases that all possible responses cannot be formulated or predetermined a priori by the interviewer. It provides flexibility 
		- Disadvantages: In an open-ended question, there is a potential for ‘say-do’ problem. Meaning that there could be a difference between what the interviewee says and what they actualy do/mean 
	- **CLOSE-ENDED QUESTIONS**
		- A close-ended question is a question that has bounded range of responses.
		- Advantages: It helps avoid context-sensitivity and introduces predictability in the answer. *Easier to analyze the responses*
		- Disadvantages: In a close-ended question, there is a potential for choices for answers to appear rather constraining *This can make the answer less useful for the interviewer*
	- Questions can be asked in either a **linear** or a **non-linear** fashion 
### The Analysis of responses to Questions (18)
1. The Halo Effect. The interviewee response is overly-optimistic (and, therefore, likely unjustifiable).

2. The Horn Effect. The interviewee response is overly-pessimistic (and, therefore, likely unjustifiable).

- Its best to look for patterns and trends as opposed to exceptions
