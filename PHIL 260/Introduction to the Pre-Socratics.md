# Introduction to Pre-Socratic Philosophy
### Thales of Miletus  ("Founder of Philosophy")

- Main argument: 
	- Water was the first principle (_arche_ / the begginning), that everything was made out of water
		- Why did he believe this? 

- Thales based his first pricnples in the materialist world: 
> (11A12) of those who first pursued philosophy, the majority believed that the only prin- ciples of all things are principles in the form of matter. For that of which all existing things are composed and that from which they originally come to be and that into which they finally perish—the substance persisting but changing in its attributes—this they state is the element and principle of the things that are. . . . For there must be one or more natures from which the rest come to be, while it is preserved. However, they do not all agree about how (Reeve, From Tales to Aristotle Edition 5)


> However, they do not all agree about how many or what kinds of such prin- ciples there are, but Thales, the founder of this kind of philosophy, stated it to be water. (This is why he declared that the earth rests on water.) He may have gotten this idea from seeing that the nourishment of all things is moist, and that even the hot itself comes to be from this and lives on this (the principle of all things is that from which they come to be)—getting this idea from this consideration and also because the seeds of all things have a moist nature; and water is the principle of the nature of moist things. (Aristotle, Metaphysics I.3 983b6–27)

- You can see that Miletus, although he comes to the wrong conclusions regarding the science of nature, used the materialist world to come to his conclusions. 
	- This is a repeasting trait of the Natural Philosophers^[1]

- Miletian society was "aristocratic and secular", alhought homeric epics were the property were the common property of all Greeks - but the stories about the gods did not amount to dogma (Mckirahan, p.18)
	- You can have religion and atheism at the same time says the prof- this sounds like the philsophers were materialist in content but exists in a superstructural theistic society. 
	- Can we reconcicle this contradiction asks the prof (between a god-believing society and this seemingly materialistic philosophy)
		- The example of the proof of the soul 
			- Why did magnets force themselves to either attach or repel from each other 
			- Argument: "if it moves it has a soul, because the sould gives movement". This extends to all moving things like plants as well 
			- This is believed my many socieities (anamilsitic souls etc, rivers having souls)
