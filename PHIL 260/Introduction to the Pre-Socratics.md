# Introduction t Pre-Socratic Philosophy
### Thales of Miletus  
> (11A12) of those who first pursued philoso- phy, the majority believed that the only prin- ciples of all things are principles in the form of matter. For that of which all existing things are composed and that from which they origi- nally come to be and that into which they finally perish—the substance persisting but changing in its attributes—this they state is the element and principle of the things that are. . . . For there must be one or more natures from which the rest come to be, while it is preserved. However, they do not all agree about how


> However, they do not all agree about how many or what kinds of such prin- ciples there are, but Thales, the founder of this kind of philosophy, stated it to be water. (This is why he declared that the earth rests on water.) He may have gotten this idea from seeing that the nourishment of all things is moist, and that even the hot itself comes to be from this and lives on this (the principle of all things is that from which they come to be)—getting this idea from this consideration and also because the seeds of all things have a moist nature; and water is the principle of the nature of moist things.

- You can see that Miletus, although he comes to the wrong conclusions regarding the science of nature, used the materialist world to come to his conclusions.
