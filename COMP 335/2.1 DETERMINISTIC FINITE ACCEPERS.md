# Deterministic Finite Accepters
> Deterministic Finite Accepters is one of the most simple finite state machines. It is finite because it has only a finite set of internal states and no other memory. It is called an accepter because it processes strings and either accepts or rejects them, so we can think of it as a simple pattern recognition mechanism.

> We say that two accepters are equivalent if they accept the same language. We can then also say that the class of nfa’s is equivalent to the class of dfa’s because for every every nfa, we can find an equivalent dfa.

### A formal definition of Deterministic Finite Accepters
- A deterministic finite accepter or dfa is defined by the quintuple M = (Q,Σ,δ,q0,F),
- Where
	- Q is a finite set of internal states,  
	- Σ is a finite set of symbols called the input alphabet,  
	- δ : Q × Σ → Q is a total function called the transition function, q0 ∈ Q is the initial state,  
	- F ⊆Q is a set of final states.

### DFAs operate in the following manner
