# Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs)
### Automaton (singular) Automata (plural)
- Finite Automaton has an input tape, a processor and somtimes an output string

### Finite Acceptor 
- A fininte acceptor has an input string, a finite automaton, and a output which is either "Accept" or not Accept 
-  A deterministic finite automata does not need to have a final state 
	- Proof: 
	- F (final states) is a subset of Q (a finite set of states)
	- the empty set is a subset of Q
